## What is Training Delivery?

Delivery is the phase when, after developing your materials, you will run the course (with an actual audience). If you have training materials in the format of slide decks, this is the phase where you present them. If you have videos or written materials, this is the phase when learners consult them. Consider that: (1) this may happen at a specific time and with a specific schedule (during a few days course) or as self-paced learning. (2) This may require interactions with you as a trainer or between participants, or none, depending on the type of activities that you included in the course design. (3) The materials hosting platform may include built-in assessment of learning, or not (e.g. short multiple choice tests to allow progression to the next chapter). All these features must be taken into account while choosing the platform to support the training delivery. Whatever the format and the activities are, you should in parallel design a way to capture the learnersâ€™ feedback about the materials (another feature which may or may not be built-in to the platform used in delivery). Feedback will be essential in this phase to understand the level of maturity of the materials and enhance them. To allow changes to be made according to the received feedback, the platform you used in phase 1 should still be available to you.

## What are the logistical aspects?

In this stage, a lot of logistics aspeects are important. This includes:

- to create a registration page of the course
- to announce and dissiminate the course and trainig event
- to organise the course day in case of a physical event like venue, catering, list of attendance, etc. 
- to advertise the use of the ELIXIR Code of Conduct
- to prepare the room and ensure all technical necessities (beamer, screen, wifi, plugs) work as expected
- to prepare a link to the short-term feedback survey
