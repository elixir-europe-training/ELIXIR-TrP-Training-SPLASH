## What is Training Development?

Development is the phase where you are designing and adding content to your training materials, ideally following the guide of the relative learning objectives and learning experiences. This might be a collaborative process, involving several lesson developers or a main developer and some contributors providing feedback. If you are developing your materials in collaboration, using an online platform in this phase may provide the essential advantage of allowing real-time collaboration (although not all the online platforms do), but there are other advantages linked to using an online platform, such as: the possibility to develop materials from anywhere at any time (for example, if your working laptop is not available), use the online resource as a backup strategy, the possibility to take advantage of the online resource feature to move the training materials to the following stages.
