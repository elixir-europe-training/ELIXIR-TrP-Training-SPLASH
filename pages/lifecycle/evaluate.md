## What is Training Evaluation?

## What can happen as a result of Training Evaluation?

*Sharing*

Depending on the type of content, some learners might benefit from accessing the materials even after the course ends, to consolidate their knowledge, to access optional information that you didn’t cover during the delivery, to (re)run some learning experiences, etc. The sharing phase is when you allow them to access the training materials asynchronously with the delivery phase: it might happen or not, but it should always happen in a FAIR process. We encourage you to consider the potential benefits of sharing the materials even before the delivery (e.g. to support some types of learners with impairments), but an extended discussion about this is beyond the current chapter’s scope. Similarly, we encourage you to consider sharing your materials with other audiences, e.g. potential contributors, other trainers, experts. Once they will get to know about your training materials (phase 3), you can allow them to access the platform where you design them (phase 1), which may or may not be the same, and contribute to them.

*Archiving*

As Sharing, archiving might not always happen. This is the case when you are not actively delivering a course anymore, or for various reasons you are not actively sharing the materials with learners and/or contributors (e.g. they are outdated), but you still want to keep an history of them and to support acknowledgment of who authored them in the past. In this phase, you should not need to be able to edit them, and you would rather “freeze” a specific version to be stored with extensive metadata about its contributors, when and where the course was delivered, and other information potentially useful for the trainers much more than for the learners.
